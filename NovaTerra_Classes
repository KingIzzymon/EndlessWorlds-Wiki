# Nova Terra: Classes

Classes are a significant part of gameplay in Nova Terra, as each class grants the player a set of skills and abilities that they can work to improve. As they master their class skills, other abilities and skills are unlocked. With full mastery of a class, another set of skills and abilities, as well as advancements, are available to the player.

Classes have three states. Apprentice is the initial state of a class. Journeyman is reached once the player has unlocked all of a classes abilities. Master is when the class has been fully mastered, rewarding the player with a Mastery Ability, bonuses, and a class advancement path according to the way the player has played the class.

Every class can fall into one or more of five categories: combat, utility, support, production, and leadership. Combat classes focus on one's fighting ability and provide proficiencies in weapons and armor, thus being suitable to players wanting to focus on dealing large amounts of damage or on taking damage in place of their teammates. Utility classes usually have some combat ability but also focus on non-combat roles, such as picking locks or wilderness survival, while also possessing bonuses that apply in certain terrains. Support classes focus on improving the attacks and defenses of their allies or on minimizing those of their enemies while also being the primary healers for their teammates. Production classes lack combat abilities but proficient in producing goods or providing technical services. Leadership classes are more rare. They provide bonuses to organizing players or non-player characters (NPCs).

There is usually a direct correlation between how many categories a class falls into with how many words constitute the class's name (i.e. how rare the class is). For example, the Warrior is a common class that falls under the combat category, but the Holy Guardian is an uncommon class that falls under both the combat and support categories. In addition to the single category common and dual category uncommon classes, triple category classes are rare and quadruple category classes are unique (not all classes follow this pattern, however, such as the Master Locksmith which is an uncommon class that only falls under the utility category). There are only four known rare classes and five known unique classes in Nova Terra.
