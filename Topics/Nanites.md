# Nanites

Nanites are a swarm of self replicating machines that operate using a hive-mind-structured artificial intelligence that were used to repair Thorn's body.

## Backstory

As mentioned in "Tower #7: Challenger", the nanites were "discovered" by [Kamag'tal](Kamag'tal.md) and were stored in the Earth as a containment vessel to raise his son [Thorn](Thorn.md) and nurture the other sentient minds within the nanite swarm.
