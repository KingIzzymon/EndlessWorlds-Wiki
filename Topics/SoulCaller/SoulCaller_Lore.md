# Soul Caller: Lore

This is a compilation of lore mentioned within the story that may give reference to connections throughout the Endless Worlds.

## "The Legendary Warriors"

Mentioned in "Soul Caller 2", The Legendary Warriors were a group of warriors who were called by their great spirit to undergo a trial which would better attune them to the great spirit. (Possibly similar to the gods of Nova Terra and their avatars.)
