# Corvo

Corvo has the Veiled Jester class and is the avatar of [Huginn](Huginn.md). While not at all suited for fighting, he is an excellent analyst and advisor as well as proficient in gathering information, an invaluable asset. He is also very curious about the history of the world, especially the history that is currently being written.

## Backstory

Corvo has been playing since soon after the game's release, and it was not long until Huginn chose him as the god's avatar. Due to the god's role as overseer and mediator, Corvo's quests usually consisted of traveling around acting as a messenger or recorder. He is also the weakest avatar from the perspective of combat, so he always finds himself on the losing end of avatar challenges.
