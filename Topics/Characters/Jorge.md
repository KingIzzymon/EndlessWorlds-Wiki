# Jorge

Jorge, a dwarf Shadow Assassin, has stealth and invisibility abilities which allow him to deal an extreme amount of damage at close range. He is a professional player previously employed by Ragnarok, but has since parted ways with the guild.

A bit rough around the edges and competitive, Jorge enjoys having fun, sometimes at the expense of others. He is also not one for lots of conversation, prefering to get to the point rather than beating around the bush.

## Backstory

Not much is known about Jorge's background, but he was a professional player registered to Ragnarok's third team, along with Velin and Mina, led by Ouroboros. In addition to the role he plays as a silent rogue, using his stealth to defeat enemies, he also acts as a scout for his guild.
