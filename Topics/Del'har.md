# Del'har

Captain Del'har is the captain of the First Company under Lord Greymane of Fang Valley. He is a wolfkin native to the region, and before the hunt for followers of Hati he held this same position under the preceding Greymane of that time. The safety and honor of his lord are of utmost concern, as well as the honor of Hati, his god. Anyone who speaks dishonorably of either in his presence will likely find a blade at their throat. Captain Del'har is fiercely loyal and focused on the task of defending his liege and Fang Valley.
