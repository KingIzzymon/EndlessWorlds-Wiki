# The Titan series (aka Nova Terra)

![](../../Attachments/Series_Titan_Logo.png)

“This game is not like other games,” Thorn’s aunt warns him as the story begins.

“It’s pretty much real life and it’s as dangerous.” But after years of failed medical treatments, Thorn will try just about anything—including an experimental procedure requiring him to spend two years in the virtual world of Nova Terra.

While there, he’ll encounter enemies, ancient evil, and a forgotten god who sets Thorn on a crash course with some of the Nova Terra’s most powerful players.

## Book 1: Titan

![](../../Attachments/BookCover_Titan01_Titan.png)

### Released: December 3, 2018

### Plot

The plot of Book 1 centers around introducing the main character Xavier/Thorn, his medical condition, and his entry into Nova Terra. Since the in-game race of a player's avatar can only be selected based on their real-world physical characteristics, Xavier's size (due to a rare form of gigantism) only allows him to play as the Titan race, entering the game as Thorn. New to role-playing games in virtual reality, Thorn is discovering things for the first time, a recurring theme in the series. A natural loner, he is initially intent on solo play and achieving success on his own terms. After a chance encounter, however, he joins a four-player team as a porter, learning much about the world of Nova Terra along the way.

## Book 2: Greymane

### Released: April 1, 2019

### Plot

The plot of book 2 centers around a single quest line that Thorn received during the events of book 1 related to the “Greymane” title. He also begins to build a team with some of the characters from the previous book and new characters he meets during the course of book 2. We follow Thorn as he begins to go head-to-head with some of the main players in the guild Ragnarok.

The young Titan is forced to take a step back, beset by complications on every side. With players flocking to Greymane Valley, the pressure of ruling the Wolfkin grows, not helped by Ragnarok’s unrelenting attempts to destroy his fledgling guild.

Heading off with his friends to seek the cure to his curse, Thorn leaves Moon Wolf Citadel behind to search for the elusive World Tree.

They say it isn’t about how many times you get knocked down. Barely surviving his struggle with Arhtu the Cursed, Thorn is determined to turn his successive defeats into overwhelming victory.

The stakes have grown—and if Thorn is going to lead his friends through the danger of the looming Orc threat, he will need every advantage he can scrape together. Yet even as he forges a path forward shadows begin to stir.

One war has drawn to a close, but another has just begun. It was supposed to be an easy victory lap in the capital city, but life around Thorn is never that simple.

Thorn falls deeper into the political struggles of the Empire when the capital is rocked by a terrible murder and is forced to learn that not all problems can be solved with the heavy end of his tetsubo.
