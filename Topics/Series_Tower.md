Thrust into a world where his legendary strength will no longer save him, Thorn must rise to new heights in the Tower series.

With a god beast as his companion, an AI for a guide, and old enemies never far behind, Thorn is forced to confront not only external threats, but the limitations of his own power.

Each step he ascends into the upper worlds reveals new dangers and arcane secrets. To survive, Thorn will have to risk his life—and the lives of those he loves.

Pursued by bounty hunters intent on dragging him back in chains, Thorn soon discovers the plot is deeper than he thought.
