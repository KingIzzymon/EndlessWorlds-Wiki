# Battle Mage Farmer

![](../Resources/Attachments/Series_BattleMageFarmer_Logo.png)

If the question were one of sheer power, John Sutton would have nothing to worry about.

After earning his discharge from the royal army, he’s been granted a farm in a remote mountain valley. But despite years of crushing his enemies and gaining near-limitless abilities, John still hasn’t cracked the rules of the game. Now, his Doom Points have begun ticking higher—and John can’t make out why. All he knows is that once his Doom Points reach 100, the apocalypse begins. Unfortunately for John’s retirement plans, the fate of the world now rests on his shoulders. Again.

Oh, and there’s also the farm to run.

### Plot

A world on the precipice of the apocalypse. A secret forged in the flames of war. A chance to start over. For John Sutton, only one of those three things matters.

Retired from a decade of brutal war, he wants nothing more than a quiet pastoral life while he does his best to stem the steady increase of his Doom Points before they hit 100, signaling the start of the end. He’s been given a small farm on the outskirts of the empire as a thanks for his service, but no matter how far he travels, it’s impossible to escape the war’s devastating effects on the world.

For John Sutton, things are finally looking up… For now…

As Ellie seeks to join the ranks of Class Holders, the mystery surrounding her grandmother grows and the two of them set off to discover the truth. But her legacy as a Witch is not the only mystery that needs to be explored. A strange plant is growing in Ferdie’s field, and it’s given John a new quest.

With the mystery of the world deepening, John Sutton is running out of time.

John has failed. The apocalypse has come.

But it’s been awfully quiet for an apocalypse. After stopping Kythov the Eyeless, John and the gang barely managed to stabilize the world’s mana supply, only sort of poisoning the world in the process. With a farm to run, a valley to develop, and a mysterious door to another dimension to study, John is going to have his hands full.

Even worse, despite the apparent peace, turmoil stirs and ancient threats have begun to surface. When a mysterious tower of mages arrives in the valley, bent on enslaving the people under John’s watch, he and Ellie are forced to take a trip to try and determine if they are friend or foe. At the same time, the powerful new emperor of Allera has ordered his implacable army to raze Lepiera’s capital, where Ben happens to be apprenticing, to the ground.

They started the fight. John is going to end it.  
  
Despite John’s best efforts to avoid getting pulled into a war, the Resplendent Empire is determined to crush John and Candle Scholar Tower. No sooner had he returned from the once a millennium magical competition than he discovers that the Empire has declared war, confident that they will be able to roll over John and his allies with little trouble.  
  
Yet little do they know what sort of force they have provoked. No longer a man of two minds, John sets out to end things once and for all. As the Dragon Empress Kalmeric marshal’s her forces, John puts the lessons he learned on the battlefield all those years ago to work.  
  
Venturing out from his beloved farm, John is intent on making this adventure his last so he can spend the rest of his days sitting on his porch watching his wheat grow next to those he loves.
